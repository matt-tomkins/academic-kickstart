abstract: Reconstructing the deglacial history of palaeo-glaciers provides vital information
  on retreat processes, information which can inform predictions of the future behaviour
  of many of the world's glaciers. On this basis, this paper presents 170 Schmidt
  Hammer exposure ages from moraine boulders and glacially sculpted bedrock to reveal
  the post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) history of the Wicklow Mountains, Ireland. These
  data suggest that large ice masses survived for 4–7 ka after retreat of the Irish
  Sea Ice Stream and were sustained by summit ice fields until ∼16.6 ka. Post-LGM
  retreat was driven by climate and involved numerous short-term ice front oscillations
  (≤1 ka), with widespread moraine deposition during Heinrich Stadial 1. In contrast,
  marked asynchroneity in the timing of Younger Dryas deglaciation is closely linked
  to snow redistribution which demonstrates the sensitivity of small cirque glaciers
  (≤1 km2) to local topography. This result has important implications for palaeoclimate
  reconstructions as cirque glacier dynamics may be (at least partly) decoupled from
  climate. This is further complicated by post-depositional processes which can result
  in moraine ages (e.g. 10Be) which post-date retreat. Future palaeoclimate studies
  should prioritize cirques where snow-contributing areas are small and where post-depositional
  disturbance of moraines is limited.
