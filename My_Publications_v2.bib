	abstract = {Glacial cirques are widely used palaeoenvironmental indicators, and are key to understanding the role of glaciers in shaping mountain topography. However, notable uncertainty persists regarding the rate and timing of cirque erosion. In order to address this uncertainty, we analyse the dimensions of 2208 cirques in Britain and Ireland and model ice accumulation to investigate the degree of coupling between glacier occupation times and cirque growth. Results indicate that during the last 120 ka, cirques were glacier-free for an average of 52.0 ± 21.2 ka (43 ± 18\%); occupied by small (largely cirque-confined) glaciers for 16.2 ± 9.9 ka (14 ± 8\%); and occupied by large glaciers, including ice sheets, for 51.8 ± 18.6 ka (43 ± 16\%). Over the entire Quaternary (i.e. 2.6 Ma), we estimate that cirques were glacier-free for 1.1 ± 0.5 Ma; occupied by small glaciers for 0.3 ± 0.2 Ma; and occupied by large glaciers for 1.1 ± 0.4 Ma. Comparing occupation times to cirque depths, and calculating required erosion rates, reveals that continuous cirque growth during glacier occupation is unlikely. Instead, we propose that cirques attained much of their size during the first occupation of a non-glacially sculpted landscape (perhaps during the timeframe of a single glacial cycle). During subsequent glacier occupations, cirque growth may have slowed considerably, with the highest rates of subglacial erosion focused during periods of marginal (small glacier) glaciation. We propose comparatively slow rates of growth following initial cirque development because a ‘least resistance’ shape is formed, and as cirques deepen, sediment becomes trapped subglacially, partly protecting the bedrock from subsequent erosion. In support of the idea of rapid cirque growth, we present evidence from northern British Columbia, where cirques of comparable size to those in Britain and Ireland developed in less than 140 ka. © 2019 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd. © 2019 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Reconstructing the deglacial history of palaeo-glaciers provides vital information on retreat processes, information which can inform predictions of the future behaviour of many of the world's glaciers. On this basis, this paper presents 170 Schmidt Hammer exposure ages from moraine boulders and glacially sculpted bedrock to reveal the post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) history of the Wicklow Mountains, Ireland. These data suggest that large ice masses survived for 4–7 ka after retreat of the Irish Sea Ice Stream and were sustained by summit ice fields until ∼16.6 ka. Post-LGM retreat was driven by climate and involved numerous short-term ice front oscillations (≤1 ka), with widespread moraine deposition during Heinrich Stadial 1. In contrast, marked asynchroneity in the timing of Younger Dryas deglaciation is closely linked to snow redistribution which demonstrates the sensitivity of small cirque glaciers (≤1 km2) to local topography. This result has important implications for palaeoclimate reconstructions as cirque glacier dynamics may be (at least partly) decoupled from climate. This is further complicated by post-depositional processes which can result in moraine ages (e.g. 10Be) which post-date retreat. Future palaeoclimate studies should prioritize cirques where snow-contributing areas are small and where post-depositional disturbance of moraines is limited.},

To test this 10Be-SH calibration curve, 100 surfaces were sampled from five ice-front positions in the Têt catchment, eastern Pyrenees, with results verified against independent 10Be and 14C ages. Gaussian modelling differentiates Holocene (9.4±0.6 ka), Younger Dryas (12.6±0.9 ka), Oldest Dryas (16.1±0.5 ka), last glacial maximum (LGM; 24.8±0.9 ka) and Würmian maximum ice extent stages (MIE; 40.9±1.1 ka). These data confirm comparable glacier lengths during the LGM and MIE ({\textasciitilde}300 m difference), in contrast to evidence from the western Pyrenees (≥15 km), reflecting the relative influence of Atlantic and Mediterranean climates. Moreover, Pyrenean glaciers advanced significantly during the LGM, with a local maximum at {\textasciitilde}25 ka, driven by growth of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, southward advection of the polar front, and a solar radiation minimum in the Northern Hemisphere.

	abstract = {Recent research has established Schmidt Hammer exposure dating (SHED) as an effective method for dating glacial landforms in the UK. This paper presents new data and discussion to clarify and to evaluate calibration procedures. These make a distinction between Schmidt Hammer drift following use (instrument calibration), and variation between both individual Schmidt Hammers and between user strategies when utilising age-calibration curves (age calibration). We show that while test anvil methods are useful for verifying that Schmidt Hammers maintain their standard R-values, they are inappropriate for instrument calibration except for the hardest natural rock surfaces (R-values: ≥ 70). A range of surfaces were tested using 3 N-Type Schmidt Hammers, which showed that existing anvil calibration procedures led to consistent overestimation of R-values by up to 17.9\%. In contrast, new calibration procedures, which are based on the use of a calibration point which lies within the range of R-values measured in the field [Dortch et al. 2016, Quat. Geochron., 35, 67–68], limit variance to maximum of 4.4\% for surfaces typically tested by Quaternary researchers (R-values: 25–60). Moreover, these new calibration procedures are more appropriate for age calibration as they incorporate operator variance through choice of sampling location. New calibration procedures are used to compile an updated age-calibration curve based upon 54 granite surfaces (R2 = 0.94, p {\textless} .01) from across Scotland, NW England and Ireland. The inclusion of a further 29 terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) exposure ages extends the calibration period to 0.8–23.8 ka, covering the entire post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) history of the British-Irish Ice Sheet. To facilitate comparison between studies, an online calculator is made available at http://shed.earth for Schmidt Hammer instrument and age calibration and SHED exposure age calculation. The SHED-Earth calculator provides a rapid and accessible means of exposure age calculation to encourage wider and more consistent application of SHED throughout the British Isles.},

	abstract = {Rock-slope failures (RSFs) constitute significant natural hazards, but the geophysical processes that control their timing are poorly understood. However, robust chronologies can provide valuable information on the environmental controls on RSF occurrence: information that can inform models of RSF activity in response to climatic forcing. This study uses Schmidt-hammer exposure-age dating (SHD) of boulder deposits to construct a detailed regional Holocene chronology of the frequency and magnitude of small rock-slope failures (SRSFs) in Jotunheimen, Norway. By focusing on the depositional fans of SRSFs (≤103 m3), rather than on the corresponding features of massive RSFs ( 108 m3), 92 single-event RSFs are targeted for chronology building. A weighted SHD age–frequency distribution and probability density function analysis indicated four centennial- to millennial-scale periods of enhanced SRSF frequency, with a dominant mode at 4.5 ka. Using change detection and discreet Meyer wavelet analysis, in combination with existing permafrost depth models, we propose that enhanced SRSF activity was primarily controlled by permafrost degradation. Long-term relative change in permafrost depth provides a compelling explanation for the high-magnitude departures from the SRSF background rate and accounts for: (i) the timing of peak SRSF frequency; (ii) the significant lag ( 2.2 ka) between the Holocene Thermal Maximum and the SRSF frequency peak; and (iii) the marked decline in frequency in the late-Holocene. This interpretation is supported by geomorphological evidence, as the spatial distribution of SRSFs is strongly correlated with the aspect-dependent lower altitudinal limit of mountain permafrost in cliff faces. Results are indicative of a causal relationship between episodes of relatively warm climate, permafrost degradation and the transition to a seasonal-freezing climatic regime. This study highlights permafrost degradation as a conditioning factor for cliff collapse, and hence the importance of paraperiglacial processes; a result with implications for slope instability in glacial and periglacial environments under global warming scenarios.},

The BIS is an effective analogue for contemporary glacial systems but our understanding of its retreat under changing climate conditions is constrained by a limited number of dates obtained from existing methods (14C, OSL). These methods are restricted in their application to glacial environments and while TCND has addressed this to some degree, its cost and potential for outliers encourage the establishment of new techniques. SHED fulfils this requirement by providing a cost-efficient method for obtaining numerous direct ages that are of comparable accuracy and precision to TCND. A multi-lithology approach has established that many rock types are unsuitable for numerical dating. However, a robust calibration curve was generated (R2 = 0.81, p = {\textless} 0.01) for granite surfaces and applied to 31 undated granite erratics on Shap Fell, NW England. SHED indicates that BIS retreat occurred at 16.5 ± 0.5 ka, a conclusion which supports our current understanding of regional deglaciation and indicates that SHED can be a valuable and cost-effective geochronological tool.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide dating of ice-marginal moraines can provide unique insights into Quaternary glacial history. However, pre- and post-depositional exposure histories of moraine boulders can introduce geologic uncertainty to numerical landform ages. To avoid geologic outliers, boulders are typically selected based on their depositional context and individual characteristics but while these criteria have good qualitative reasoning, many have not been tested quantitatively. Of these, boulder location is critical, as boulders located on moraine crests are prioritised, while those on moraine slopes are typically rejected. This study provides the first quantitative assessment of the relative utility of moraine crest and moraine slope sampling using new and published 10Be and 36Cl ages (n = 19) and Schmidt hammer sampling (SH; n = 635 moraine boulders, ∼19,050 SH R-values) in the northern and southern Pyrenees. These data show that for many of the studied moraines, the spatial distribution of “good” boulders is effectively random, with no consistent clustering on moraine crests, ice-proximal or -distal slopes. In turn, and in contrast to prior work, there is no clear penalty to either moraine crest or moraine slope sampling. Instead, we argue that landform stability exerts a greater influence on exposure age distributions than the characteristics of individual boulders. For the studied landforms, post-depositional stability is strongly influenced by sedimentology, with prolonged degradation of matrix-rich unconsolidated moraines while boulder-rich, matrix-poor moraines stabilised rapidly after deposition. While this pattern is unlikely to hold true in all settings, these data indicate that differences between landforms can be more significant than differences at the intra-landform scale. As ad hoc assessment of landform stability is extremely challenging based on geomorphological evidence alone, preliminary SH sampling, as utilised here, is a useful method to assess the temporal distribution of boulder exposure ages and to prioritise individual boulders for subsequent analysis.},

	abstract = {While revolutionary to the geomorphic community, the application of terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) dating is complicated by geological uncertainties, which often lead to skewed or poorly clustered TCN age distributions. Although a range of statistical approaches are typically used to detect and remove outliers, few are optimized for analysis of TCN datasets. Many are mean- or median-based and therefore explicitly assume a single probability distribution (e.g., Mean Squared Weighted Deviates, Chauvenet's Criterion, etc.). Given the ubiquity of pre- and post-depositional modification of rock surfaces, which occur at different rates in different geomorphic settings, these approaches struggle with multimodal distributions which often characterize TCN datasets. In addition, most statistical approaches do not propagate measurement or production rate uncertainties, which become increasingly important as dataset size or clustering increases. Finally, most approaches provide arithmetic single solutions, irrespective of geologic context. To address these limitations, we present the Probabilistic Cosmogenic Age Analysis Tool (P-CAAT), a new approach for outlier detection and landform age analysis. This tool incorporates both sample age and geologic uncertainties and uses Monte Carlo simulations to eliminate dataset skewness by isolating component normal distributions from a cumulative probability density estimate for datasets with three or more samples. This approach allows geologic context to inform post-analysis interpretations, as researchers can assign landform ages based upon statistically distinct subpopulations, informed by the characteristics of geomorphic systems (e.g., exhumation of boulders as moraines degrade through time). To evaluate the effectiveness of P-CAAT, we analyzed a range of synthetic TCN datasets and compared the results to commonly used statistical approaches for outlier detection. Irrespective of dataset size or clustering, P-CAAT outperformed other approaches and returned accurate solutions that improve in precision as sample size increases. To enable more comprehensive utilization of our approach, P-CAAT is packaged with a GUI interface and is available for download at kgs. uky.edu/anorthite/PCAAT.},

Some temperate mountain glaciers were present during the Miocene Climatic Optimum ({\textasciitilde}15 Ma), before a widespread switch to cold-based glaciation.

	abstract = {Knowledge of glaciation in Britain and Ireland has a long and rich history, and the earliest ideas surrounding the nature of the Quaternary ice ages were developed and established based on observations in these islands. The complex and varied geology has led to a diverse range of glacial landscapes. Britain and Ireland were extensively glaciated during the Pleistocene with ice reaching to the continental shelf far offshore of the modern coastline. All of Ireland was covered by ice, while only the southernmost parts of Britain have never been glaciated. Thus the modern landscapes we see today in most of Britain and Ireland, from the mountains to the lowlands, are the direct result of glaciation.},

	abstract = {The most extensive ice sheets over Britain and Ireland formed during the Middle Pleistocene in the Anglian Stage [Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 12] and the Late Wolstonian Substage (MIS 6). The landforms and associated sediments are widely preserved in Southern England but are largely absent from the rest of Britain and Ireland because the last ice sheet covered these areas. Despite the restricted evidence, the Middle Pleistocene glaciations had a profound impact on the landscapes of Britain and Ireland. For example, Britain became an island for the first time in Anglian Stage and the Middle Pleistocene Ice Sheets essentially determined the modern drainage of Southern England. Early pre-Last Glacial Maximum glacier advance in the Devensian Stage [MIS 5d-2; Last Glacial Cycle (LGC)] is elusive but significant ice cover is indicated in the sedimentological and geomorphological records early in the LGC, in MIS 4 and 3, in several parts of both Britain and Ireland.},

	abstract = {At the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), Britain and Ireland were covered by the British–Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS): a dynamic ice mass that comprised the southwestern extremity of the much larger European Ice Sheet Complex. However, our understanding of the extent of the BIIS has changed dramatically in recent years from a previously established view of a more restricted ice sheet, located mostly on the present-day landmass, and with significant ice-free enclaves, to an extensive marine-terminating ice sheet. Deciphering the extent and chronology of the BIIS is critical for understanding landscape evolution. It is now clear that the LGM was just one phase of an evolving ice-sheet complex, with evidence for asynchronous maximum extents across the ice-sheet sectors. Based on the lateral extents of the BIIS, the ice mass must have been sufficiently thick to completely submerge the highest terrain in the interior of the ice sheet. The widespread presence of trimlines and strongly weathered mountain summits is now mostly interpreted as evidence of nonerosive cold-based ice, rather than as LGM ice thickness markers in the landscape. Deciphering landscape history using geomorphology alone (in the absence of geochronology) is therefore complicated and can be problematic. Our understanding on the evolution of the ice sheet through time has been dramatically improved in recent years by comprehensive geochronological programmes involving BRITICE-CHRONO and other teams.},
